## Tip 1: Master Your Lighting

Lighting is the single most important factor in product photography. Poor lighting can make even the best products look cheap, while great lighting can elevate simple items.

### Natural Light Tips

- Shoot near a large window on overcast days for soft, even light
- Avoid direct sunlight which creates harsh shadows
- Use a white foam board to bounce light onto shadow sides

### Artificial Light Tips

- Invest in a simple softbox or ring light ($30-100)
- Use two lights: one main light and one fill light
- Maintain consistent color temperature (avoid mixing warm and cool lights)

## Tip 2: Use a Clean, Consistent Background

Cluttered backgrounds distract from your product and look unprofessional.

### Quick Solutions

- **White seamless paper**: The classic choice, available at any craft store
- **Light gray backgrounds**: More forgiving than pure white
- **Lifestyle surfaces**: Wood, marble, or fabric for contextual shots

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: With AI tools like BrandCam, you can easily replace any background after shooting, so focus on capturing the product well first.

## Tip 3: Shoot Multiple Angles

One photo is never enough. E-commerce shoppers want to see:

1. **Hero shot**: The main view, usually front-facing
2. **Alternative angles**: Side, back, three-quarter views
3. **Detail shots**: Close-ups of materials, textures, special features
4. **Scale reference**: Show the product in context or with familiar objects
5. **In-use shots**: Model photos or lifestyle images

### The Ideal Number

Studies show **5-8 images per product** optimize conversion rates. More is usually better.

## Tip 4: Post-Processing Basics

Even great photos benefit from basic editing:

### Essential Adjustments

| Adjustment | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Exposure | Ensure the image is properly bright |
| White balance | Colors should look natural |
| Contrast | Add depth without losing detail |
| Crop | Center your product with appropriate margins |

### Tools to Use

- **Free**: Canva, GIMP, Phone editing apps
- **Paid**: Adobe Lightroom, Capture One
- **AI**: BrandCam for automatic enhancement

## Tip 5: Maintain Consistency Across Your Catalog

Inconsistent product photos make your store look unprofessional and confuse customers.

### What to Keep Consistent

- Background color and style
- Lighting setup and direction
- Image size and aspect ratio
- Margin/padding around products
- Color accuracy

### Create a Style Guide

Document your photography standards:

```
📸 Photography Style Guide
├── Camera settings
├── Lighting setup
├── Background materials
├── Editing presets
└── File naming conventions
```

## Bonus: Leverage AI for Efficiency

AI tools can help you achieve professional results faster:

- **Background removal**: Instant, clean cutouts
- **Model generation**: Virtual try-ons without real models
- **Scene creation**: Lifestyle shots from studio photos
- **Batch processing**: Consistent edits across hundreds of images
