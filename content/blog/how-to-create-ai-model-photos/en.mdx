## Why Use AI Model Photos?

Model photography has traditionally been one of the most expensive aspects of product marketing. Hiring models, booking studios, paying photographers, and coordinating schedules can easily cost $5,000-$20,000 per shoot. AI model photography changes this completely.

### Benefits of AI Model Photos

The quality of your input photo directly affects the output. Follow these tips:

**For Clothing:**
